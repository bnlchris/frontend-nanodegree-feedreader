# Feed Reader Testing by Udacity

## What is it?

Feed Reader Testing is part of the [Front End Nanodegree](https://de.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). Students are to show their skills in working with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), that is, using tests to ensure the code is doing as expected.

## What do you need?

If you want to use the Feed Reader, feel free to clone the folder using [Git](https://github.com/bnlchris/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git).

## My contribution

Udacity provided all students with the starter code, containing HTML, CSS and a JS file. The Jasmine architecure was provided, too.

I added seven tests as requested to pass the project. For more, take a look in the [spec folder](https://github.com/bnlchris/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/tree/master/jasmine/spec).
